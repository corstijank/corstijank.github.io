      <title>Just deal with it - Agile lessons from competitive gaming</title>

      <description>After watching competitive StarCraft 2 last night, I kind of feel like writing a post on how playing a game can work wonders for your agile mindset.
Oftentimes, when I learn, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember things &amp;lsquo;in their context&amp;rsquo;; for example, I don&amp;rsquo;t read IT related books. They just don&amp;rsquo;t stick. I do remember &amp;lsquo;similar&amp;rsquo; things. Things that are more or less the same but in a completely different context. My wife explains it where my mind is basically working like one of those crazy detective walls, with the pictures and the strings.</description>

      <title>Monday Mini: Protobufs from JSON in Java</title>

      <description>On my pet project, I am using protocol buffers as Interface Language (IDL). Using a simple, shared definition should speed things up, right? Well, kind of!
Protocol Buffers are a message format commonly used in combination with Remote Procedure Calls (RPC; or specifically, GRPC if you&amp;rsquo;re doing RPC with protobufs). If you&amp;rsquo;re working in a microservices world, you can&amp;rsquo;t really just assume every service uses these protocol buffered messages (I&amp;rsquo;ll just call them protobufs from now on) over an RPC styled interface.</description>

      <title>Getting brave with Dapr</title>

      <description>A standardized library available to help developers in things like look-ups, persistence, security or messaging, has been a goal for platform creators since before even J2EE was first released. Today, we look at the latest incarnation of this goal. It&amp;rsquo;s called DAPR, and it&amp;rsquo;s made by Microsoft. Let&amp;rsquo;s go!
Oh no, he didn&amp;rsquo;t Did he compare the latest hippest, fanciest, shiny technology to hit the market with the old-aged brontosaurus that is Java Enterprise?</description>

      <title>Crossing Styx - My journey into the (under)world of .NET - Part III</title>

      <description>In the third part of the series, our adventure is slowly but surely heading to its climax. All &amp;lsquo;characters&amp;rsquo; have been introduced. There&amp;rsquo;s DotNet Core, the new, misunderstood (or at least by me?) kid with a bunch of talent. Docker, the awesome supporting character that actually deserves his own movie. Surely there&amp;rsquo;ll be a spin-off! There&amp;rsquo;s the antagonist, Jenkins, who might end up working along with our main character more then either had hoped for.</description>

      <description>In my previous post on this topic, I somehow got the jitters to get started with .NET. Or more specifically, .NET core. Being stubborn as I am, I have created a simple delivery pipeline in Jenkins, for building and deploying a .NET core docker container.
Now, this might sound like hell freezing over. Me, programming .NET? Blasphemy! Except one little thing. For my previous post, I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually write one line of C# code.</description>

      <description>At the closing of last year, I presented an in-house talk, comparing Continuous Delivery solutions for both Java and .NET. Of course, this was not a simple side-by-side comparison; a microsoft oriented colleague and myself created a small challenge for ourselves. My colleague was going to build Java software in Team Foundation Server. And me? I was stuck creating a delivery pipeline for Microsoft .NET in Jenkins.
Now, I had been thinking about looking into .</description>

      <description>Greetings, dear reader, and welcome to my little corner of the web. It&amp;rsquo;s nearing the end of 2016, and I have decided I want to start my resolution of finally putting up some blogs before 2017 enters with a bang.
Or, at the very least, have a welcoming blog post up and running. Minimal Viable Product and all. So, with that ,I bid you welcome to Statics Must Die, the ramblings of me, Corstijan Kortsmit.</description>
