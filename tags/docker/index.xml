      <description>In the third part of the series, our adventure is slowly but surely heading to its climax. All &amp;lsquo;characters&amp;rsquo; have been introduced. There&amp;rsquo;s DotNet Core, the new, misunderstood (or at least by me?) kid with a bunch of talent. Docker, the awesome supporting character that actually deserves his own movie. Surely there&amp;rsquo;ll be a spin-off! There&amp;rsquo;s the antagonist, Jenkins, who might end up working along with our main character more then either had hoped for.</description>
