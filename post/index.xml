      <description>In the third part of the series, our adventure is slowly but surely heading to its climax. All &amp;lsquo;characters&amp;rsquo; have been introduced. There&amp;rsquo;s DotNet Core, the new, misunderstood (or at least by me?) kid with a bunch of talent. Docker, the awesome supporting character that actually deserves his own movie. Surely there&amp;rsquo;ll be a spin-off! There&amp;rsquo;s the antagonist, Jenkins, who might end up working along with our main character more then either had hoped for.</description>

      <description>In my previous post on this topic, I somehow got the jitters to get started with .NET. Or more specifically, .NET core. Being stubborn as I am, I have created a simple delivery pipeline in Jenkins, for building and deploying a .NET core docker container.
Now, this might sound like hell freezing over. Me, programming .NET? Blasphemy! Except one little thing. For my previous post, I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually write one line of C# code.</description>

      <description>At the closing of last year, I presented an in-house talk, comparing Continuous Delivery solutions for both Java and .NET. Of course, this was not a simple side-by-side comparison; a microsoft oriented colleague and myself created a small challenge for ourselves. My colleague was going to build Java software in Team Foundation Server. And me? I was stuck creating a delivery pipeline for Microsoft .NET in Jenkins.
Now, I had been thinking about looking into .</description>

      <description>Greetings, dear reader, and welcome to my little corner of the web. It&amp;rsquo;s nearing the end of 2016, and I have decided I want to start my resolution of finally putting up some blogs before 2017 enters with a bang.
Or, at the very least, have a welcoming blog post up and running. Minimal Viable Product and all. So, with that ,I bid you welcome to Statics Must Die, the ramblings of me, Corstijan Kortsmit.</description>
